### Project Description
ProFet is a fun and imaginative app designed to help you explore the mystical world of auras and energies. With Profet, you can "scan" your aura, gain unique insights, and track your personal energy patterns over time. Built as part of a hackathon project, Profet is perfect for those curious about imaginary energies and who want a touch of magic in their daily routine.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Individuals often face uncertainty about future outcomes due to limited access to what we define as the "aura constant"‚Äîan imagined, universal energy that theoretically holds predictive insights into a person‚Äôs life path.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Profet addresses the need for imaginative insight into the future by offering a suite of playful, aura-based features. AuraNet, a neural network uniquely trained to analyze a person‚Äôs aura through their mobile phone (seen as a primary aura indicator), provides future predictions. Profet also includes the Aura Finder, which scans images to detect positive and negative auras, and Dream Interpret, which analyzes dreams based on a user‚Äôs aura and descriptions. Additionally, Profet calculates a personal ‚ÄúAura Number,‚Äù a lucky charm inspired by individual aura readings. Together, these tools create a fun and mystical journey of self-discovery and insight.
